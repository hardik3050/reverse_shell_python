# reverse_shell_python

Reverse-shell is something used to being connected to some computer and run commands on them.
In day to day life internet-connection is not static (in terms of IPAddress), it's dynamic.
So to connect to some computer is not easy when we have dynamic IPAddresses.
And there are additional problems may arise in connection, for example:
    Firewall
    Operating-System Security
    port-forwarding

So in reverse-shell the basic logic is that our target system will initiate the connection to the server instead of doing reverse.
